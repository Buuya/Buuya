# Hi there, I'm Buuya! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub profile! ðŸŒŸ Here you can find some of my recent projects and contributions to the open-source community. I'm a software engineer with a passion for creating innovative solutions to complex problems. When I'm not coding, I enjoy hiking, reading, and exploring new technologies.

## Featured Projects

Here are some of my recent projects that I'm particularly proud of:

- **Weather Now**: A weather app that uses the OpenWeatherMap API to display current weather conditions for any location in the world. Users can also view hourly and daily forecasts, as well as save their favorite locations.
